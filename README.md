We welcome and encourage contributions! Fork the repository, make your enhancements, and submit a pull request. Together, we can make Plenum better for every developer in the Agility community.

## üéÅ Features

- Comprehensive UI components library, following atomic design principles and our Plenum design system for utmost consistency.
- Modern, cutting-edge tech stack with Next.js 13 and Storybook 7.1.
- Automation scripts for efficient component creation.
- Integration with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- Easy to install and integrate into any Agility CMS project.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you can take full advantage of Plenum, you need to install Tailwind CSS into your project. Follow the instructions here: [Install Tailwind CSS with Next.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)

In your app entry point (i.e., \`_app.tsx\`), import the \`globals.css\` file from the previous step, and the \`tailwind.css\` file from Plenum:

```
import "<RELATIVE_PATH>/globals.css";
import "@agility/plenum-ui/lib/tailwind.css";
```

Make sure to add any additional styles before these two import statements to prevent overwriting Plenum's styling.

## üíæ Installation

Installing Plenum into your project is a breeze. You can use either npm or yarn:

```
# Using npm:
npm install @agility/plenum-ui

# Using yarn:
yarn add @agility/plenum-ui
```

## üî® Usage

To use Plenum components in your React components:

```
import { Component } from '@agility/plenum-ui';

<Component {...ComponentProps} />
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Component Generation Script

Our Node.js script automates the creation of new components for our Storybook library. It creates a component directory with necessary files like \`Component.tsx\`, \`Component.stories.tsx\`, and \`index.tsx\`.

#### How to use the script

To use the script, you should have Node.js installed. From the terminal, you can create a new component with the following command:

```
yarn create-component ComponentName DestinationDirectory
# or
npm run create-component ComponentName DestinationDirectory
```

The command takes two arguments:

- \`ComponentName\`: The name of the new component (PascalCase, e.g., "MyComponent").
- \`DestinationDirectory\`: The directory where the new component will be created. It should be relative to the 'stories' directory (e.g., "Atoms" or "Molecules").

The script will create a new directory with the component name inside the destination directory (under the 'stories' directory), and generate three files in the new directory:

- \`ComponentName.tsx\`: The component file, which contains a basic functional component structure with a typed interface for props.
- \`ComponentName.stories.tsx\`: The Storybook story file for the new component.
- \`index.tsx\`: An index file to cleanly export the new component.
#### Example

To create a new component named "Button" in the "Atoms" directory, you would run:

```bash
node create-component.js Button Atoms
```

This would create a directory structure like:

```
- stories
  - Atoms
    - Button
      - Button.tsx
      - Button.stories.tsx
      - index.tsx
```

Each of the generated files will contain basic boilerplate code that you can start with.

#### Notes
Upon successful component creation, the script will exit and display a success message. If the directory already exists, the script will ask for confirmation before overwriting any existing files.

Please note that the script assumes that the 'stories' directory exists. If the destination directory does not exist, the script will attempt to create it. The script will also prompt you before overwriting any existing files. Use PascalCase for component names and directory names, and ensure the paths are correctly set. If you encounter any issues, you can still manually create the component and its associated files.
